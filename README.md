# Simple PHP Disk Cache by Doggie52

The *dG52 Simple PHP Disk Cache class* is a simple way for PHP developers to use disk caching in their applications. It is _easy-to-use_ and can drastically speed up repeated execution of heavy tasks (such as querying external resources).

## How to use
### Requirements
 * PHP version 5 or greater

Familiarize yourself with the simple usage by looking at [`example_usage.php`](example_usage.php).

## To-do
 * Allow individual cache timeouts to be set.
 * Purge cached variable automatically.
 * Find more efficient way to store cached variables.


The base of this class is adapted from http://xcache.lighttpd.net/wiki/XcacheApi#aSimpleOOwrapper.
