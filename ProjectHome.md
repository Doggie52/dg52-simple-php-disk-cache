# Welcome to the dG52 Simple PHP Disk Cache class by Doggie52! #

The **dG52 Simple PHP Disk Cache class** is a simple way for PHP developers to use disk caching in their applications. It is _easy-to-use_ and can drastically speed up repeated execution of heavy tasks (such as querying external resources).

## How to use ##
### Requirements ###
  * PHP version 5 or greater
### Installing ###
  1. Using an [SVN-client of choice](http://codertools.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/svn-subversion-clients-and-other-tools/), check out the latest revision of the bot to a directory of choice, using this address:
> > `http://dg52-simple-php-disk-cache.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`
  1. Familiarize yourself with the simple usage by looking at [example\_usage.php](http://code.google.com/p/dg52-simple-php-disk-cache/source/browse/trunk/example_usage.php).

## To-Do ##
  * Allow individual cache timeouts to be set.
  * Purge cached variable automatically.
  * Find more efficient way to store cached variables.
